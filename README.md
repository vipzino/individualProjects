# salaryCalculator

(Salary calculation: compound value) Suppose your starting salary is $50,000 dollars per year. Your company gives your 10% increase per year. Therefore:
 
After 1st year your salary is 50,000 + (50,000 * .10) = 55,000
 
After 2nd year your salary is 55,000 + (55,000 * .10) = 60,500
 
And so on.
 
Write a Java program that prompts the user to enter a starting salary and yearly increase rate. Calculate salary for 1st and 2nd year then print them as shown below.
 
 
Expected output:
 
Enter your starting salary:  50000.00
Enter annual increase rate: .10
After the first year your salary will be $55000.00
After the second year your salary will be $60500.00
